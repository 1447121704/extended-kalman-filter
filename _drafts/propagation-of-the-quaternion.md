title:  		"Propagation Of The Quaternion"
description:    "In this post we will see how to propagate the quaternion, the discrete time state transition and noise covariance matrix before passing to the Kalman Filter propagation equations as done by Trawny N. and Roumeliotis S."

>&quot;The quaternion is an ideal global attitude representation, since it varies continuously over $S3$ as the attitude changes, avoiding the jumps required by some three-dimensional parametrizations.&quot;
